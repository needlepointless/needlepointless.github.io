        "body": "My original purpose in the project that lead to this website was to figure out who might need sewing. It used to be a household skill and now it's widely fallen to the hobbyists, but there must've been a reason for that original widespread-ness.<br/>And of course, there was, but it seems like the hobbyists are the only audience left for it. Hand sewing has very little place now, for the obvious reason of the sewing machine. But beyond that, the sewing machine kind of made itself as a product unnecessary. Before the sewing machine, clothing was far from mass producible, it took more time and effort and care to hand sew something, but the sewing machine changed that. Once clothes could be mass produced, they became affordable, which made the ability to maintain the same clothing for a long period of time less important.<br/>However, that doesn't mean that sewing is completely obsolete. It's a good hobby, obviously, because you can throw a bunch of time into it and in the end you have a swankified new thing. But it's also useful if you don't have a whole lot of disposable income to throw into clothing, like if you are a teenager who doesn' have a job and has to rely on their parents for money.<br/><del>Sorry for the brick of text, I couldn't really split this post up very much.~~",
