You put a knot on one end of the thread, put it through a <i>hand-sewing</i> needle (because I genuinely don't really understand sewing machines yet) and then you put it through the fabric from the wrong side (which is just the side of the fabric that isn't going to be facing out or visible in the finished thing) and move some amount in a straight line on the right side and go back through the fabric. Repeat that with equal distances and you have yourself a running stitch. You can use it to hold together two pieces of fabric, and that's pretty much it unless you're into embroidery (which everyone should be because it's prett
