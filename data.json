Since clothes are so mass produceable, it's usually easier to just buy them instead. It's kind of a remnant of the yonder years, back before sewing machines. UNLESS, you're a teenager who does not have a job and thus have to rely on your parents to buy clothes for you, then you have a reason, because it's a lot easier to convince them to buy fabric than it is to convince them to buy some random shirt."},{"title": "Kinda Unrelated but...","timestamp": "November 13, 2019","thumb": "none","body": "Did you know there's a <a href='http://ismacs.net/'>society of sewing machine collectors</a> and that they are exactly as cool as they sound?"},{"title": "I Got a Sewing Machine!","timestamp": "November 14, 2019","thumb": "none","body": "<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"./assets/sew-mach.png\" style=\"width: 70%; border-radius: 20px; padding: 0.75em;margin-bottom: 5em; border: .25em dashed var(--main)\"/></div><br/>I got a sewing machine!

It's a running stitch. That's all you really need to do anything simple. You put a knot on one end of the thread, put it through a <i>hand-sewing</i> needle (because I genuinely don't really understand sewing machines yet) and then you put it through the fabric from the wrong side (which is just the side of the fabric that isn't going to be facing out or visible in the finished thing) and move some amount in a straight line on the right side and go back through the fabric. Repeat that with equal distances and you have yourself a running stitch. You can use it to hold together two pieces of fabric, and that's pretty much it unless you're into embroidery (which everyone should be because it's pretty cool)."},{"title": "Aside from Running Stitches...","timestamp": "November 15, 2019","thumb": "none","body": "While a running stitch is the only thing you really need, if you want to do anything cool things get complicated fast <a href='https://sewguide.com/invisible-stitches/'>(like this witchcraft)</a>. There are also a variety of needles you want to use depending on your fabric. They're all pretty much the same thing with slightly varying radii and sharpnesses. You can't really figure out which one you need without understanding fabrics (which I don't). For instance, if your working with a knit fabric, you want to use a needle with a rounder point so that you aren't going through the threads that make up the fabric, but around them."}],"patterns": [{"title": "Gloves #1","timestamp": "November 15, 2019","thumb": "none","body": "<a href=\"https://www.threadsmagazine.com/2009/08/25/patterns-for-gorgeous-gloves\">Source</a><br />A simple glove pattern I found."},{"title": "Gloves #2","timestamp": "November 15, 2019","thumb": "https://so-sew-easy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_6927-768x512.jpg","body": "<a href=\"https://so-sew-easy.com/easy-gloves-pattern-winter-comfort/\">Source</a><br/>The pattern seems a bit more crude than the first one (as far as glove patterns go at least, they're already pretty simple), but the instructions are more thorough."}],"projects": [{"title": "Gloves","timestamp": "November 15, 2019","thumb": "none","body": "I'm thinking about trying to make gloves because it's around that season, the patterns look pretty simple, and I have some denim that I don't know what to do with."}]}
